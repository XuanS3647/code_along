# AI-Assisted SQL Code Along Projects
## 📌 Overview

This repository contains two AI-assisted SQL Code Along projects completed on DataCamp, guided by John Brazier-Beckett and Sara Billen.
The projects focus on using AI prompting techniques to efficiently write, refine, and optimize SQL queries for data analysis.

## 🎯 Objectives

Leverage AI assistance to generate and improve SQL queries

Apply filtering, grouping, and sorting to explore datasets

Use conditional logic to answer business-driven questions

Develop a structured approach to AI-assisted data analysis

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools

SQL (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, CASE)

AI-assisted query generation & refinement

Data exploration and pattern identification

Analytical thinking and problem decomposition
