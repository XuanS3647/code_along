We are going to explore how the London Fire Brigade's animal rescue efforts correlate with city-wide census data. \n\n### 📊 Our data\n\nThis project will use an aggregated and filtered (2011 only) version of the data from the [London Fire Brigade](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb-2ogkn/) and the [2011 Census of the United Kingdom](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/census-2011-population-by-age-uk-districts-2jkq6/). In this case, the data is saved to a BigQuery database. You can find the tables in the `public` schema.\n\n<br>\n\n**Table 1: `animal_rescues_summary`**\n| Column | Description |\n|---|---|\n| `area_code` | Geographic code. |\n| `area` | Name of the London borough. |\n| `nb_incidents` | Number of animal rescues. |\n| `total_nb_units_deployed` | Number of fire units/vehicles used. |\n| `total_service_duration_hrs` | Total time of all rescues. |\n| `avg_hourly_cost` | The average cost per hour for the rescue. |\n\n<br>\n\n**Table 2: `census_data`**\n| Column | Description |\n|---|---|\n| `area_code` | Geographic code. |\n| `area` | Name of the UK borough. |\n| `region` | Name of the region the borough belongs to. |\n| `nb_residents` | Total population in the borough. |\n| `age_0_to_14`, `age_15_to_24`, `age_25_to_64`, `age_over_65` | Age demographic counts. |\n\n\n### 🤖 The AI Workflow\nWhen solving a question, follow the following steps:\n1. Think about the data you have and what you want to achieve.\n2. Write a natural language prompt.\n3. Understand the code generated by the AI.\n4. Check the AI’s code for errors or hallucinations.\n5. Run the code and verify the results.\n6.

It allows you to query data that is spread across different parts of a database as if it were a single set.\n\nThe `INNER JOIN` is the most common type of join. It acts like a filter: it only returns rows where there is a match in both tables.\n- If a row in Table A **has** a corresponding value in Table B, those rows are merged and included in the results.\n- If a row in Table A **doesn't** have a match in Table B (or vice-versa), that row is excluded from the final output entirely.\n\n<br>\n\n![ing_inner_join](img_inner_join.png)\n\nLet's

Don't ask the AI for a 50-line query at once. Ask for the join first, verify the data, and then prompt the AI to add aggregations or complex math.\n- **Be the editor**: Always scrutinize the AI’s output. Check that it’s using the correct table aliases and watch out for \"hallucinated\" column names that don't exist in your schema.\n- **The error loop**: If the AI gives you an error, don't give up. Copy and paste the exact error message back into the prompt. The AI is often better at fixing its own mistakes than writing perfect code on the first try.\n- **Context is king**: Always start your session by telling the AI exactly which tables and columns you have. The better the AI understands your \"world,\" the better its code will be.\n\nGreat job today! You are now ready to blend disparate data sources and find hidden insights using the power of AI.","metadata":{},"id":"9b167b5e-bc97-46fc-834d-63b5a960c3b9","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.12.11","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (User venv)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"editor":"DataLab"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
